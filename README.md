# WheatBreeding4WarmingClimate
Predict genotypes' responses across future climatic environments 
This is the script for a paper in Nature Climate Change - New Wheat Breeding Paradigms for a Warming Climate.
The script is used for 
1. Training a mixed model with the IWIN dataset,
2. Predict yield response and GxE under five Global Climate Models (GCM) under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP),
3. Analyze prediction yield responses for different warming scenarios,
4. Plot the results, four figures in the NCC paper main text and nine figures in the NCC supplementary materials.
